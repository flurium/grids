        <p>
          Developing off grid isn't real, so you must be on as MANY grids as possible.
          Grids will provide a fast and cost-effective way to utilize numerous services
          without becoming overly dependent on any one of them.
        </p>

          <summary>Cost effective</summary>
          <p>
            Because you use several services, you can get more free plan resources. It's
            great for startups. Every business should be started for free.
          </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Never go down</summary>
          <p>
            Grids is a serverless thing. Each request is independent of others. If someone
            tryes to attack us, you will not notice, because you are separetad. And even
            if cloud platform will go down, we have backup deployments on other platforms.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>All over the globe</summary>
          <p>
            As I said before we are serverless. So our API is disrubited around whole
            world. You will make request to the closes one automatically. It will give you
            the fastest responses.
          </p>

        <details>
          <summary>Speed</summary>
          <p>
            The technologies we choose are fast to run and fast to develop with. You get
            speed during calling API. We get speed to fix bugs and add new functionality.
