          Developing off grid isn't real, so you must be on as MANY grids as possible.
          Grids will provide a fast and cost-effective way to utilize numerous services

            Using multiple services provides extra free plan resources, making it
            particularly beneficial for startups. Starting a business without initial
            costs is a favorable approach that every entrepreneur should consider.

        <details>
          <summary>Never go down</summary>
          <p>
            Grids operate as a serverless solution. Each request functions independently
            from others. In the event of an attempted attack, it would go unnoticed due to
            the isolation. Moreover, even if a cloud platform experiences downtime, we
            have backup deployments on alternative platforms.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>All over the globe</summary>
          <p>
            Like I mentioned earlier, we're using a serverless setup, which means our API
            is spread out all over the world. Whenever you make a request, it'll
            automatically go to the closest server, giving you the quickest responses.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Speed</summary>
          <p>
            We go for technologies that are fast to use and easy to develop with. This
            means you experience speed when you call our API, and we're able to quickly
            address any bugs or add new features.
