# Flurium Grids

Developing off grid isn't real, so you must be on as MANY grids as possible.

Flurium Grids manage all grids/services you have to be never down.
Grids are never down, because we are serverless on several platforms.

## Emails

Sending emails can go wrong, or you will reach limits.
Grids will manage limits and errors during sending emails.
