# Flurium Grids
Developing off grid isn't real, so you must be on as MANY grids as possible. 

Flurium Grids manage all grids/services you have to be never down.
Grids are never down, because we are serverless on several platforms.

## Emails
Sending emails can go wrong or you will reach limits. 
Grids will manage limits and errors during sending emails.

Services we are/will be supporting: 
| Service | Supported | 
|---------|-----------|
| Resend  | [ ]       |
| Postmark| [ ]       |
